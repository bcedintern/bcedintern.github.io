          <p>The Fritz Behnke Historical Museum is named after Fritz Behnke, who was actually born in Paramus in 1919. As you walk through the first floor of the museum, check out the furnishings of the farmhouse, including the utensils used for cooking and cleaning, washing, ironing, and sewing, which were all part of a housewife’s daily chores. One of the first electric washing machines is on display, a duplicate of which is currently in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC. Other items on display include an old ice box (refrigerator), a wood-burning stove, and an early gas stove.

          <p>The Hopper-Goetschius house on the corner of Lake Street and East Saddle River Road dates back to 1739. Built by the Hopper family, it is the oldest remaining house in Upper Saddle River. We know it existed in 1739 because it was recorded in surveyor Charles Clinton's journal, and possibly it is older. Rosalie Fellows Bailey in her book on pre-Revolutionary Dutch houses, says it was marked as the home of Gerrit Hoppa on a rough sheepskin map made about 1713.</p>

          <p>On January 9, 1804, Jacob Van Winkle deeded a strip of land to school trustees for the construction of a school. Van Winkle requested a token yearly rent of just one peppercorn, if demanded, for the land. The peppercorn was a dried berry of black pepper, expensive in quantity because it was an Asian spice that had to be imported by ship. The first schoolhouse was erected that same year with money raised by subscription. The cost was $162.20. Thus was born the first known public school system in Bergen County.</p>

          <p>The Hermitage in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, is a National Historic Landmark that is also listed on the National and State Registers of Historic Places. Its picturesque Gothic Revival design dates from a remodeling completed in 1847–48 by the architect William H. Ranlett for Elijah Rosencrantz Jr. The rarity and completeness of its architecture is the basis for The Hermitage's National Historic Landmark designation. The Hermitage is much more than a historic house museum. It is a focal point for our community and an invaluable resource for everyone living and working in the local area. </p>
