    			<p>Snow and ice don't make for ideal golfing conditions, so these county golf courses use the wintry weather to their advantage by offering cross-country skiing. Skiers are asked not to ski across the greens. Rockleigh spans across 264 acres at the base of the Palisades' western slope in Bergen County's Northern Valley, while Orchard Hill is a smaller, nine-hole course.</p>
