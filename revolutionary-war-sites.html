          <p>Originally called “Peterfield” this mid 18th century mansion was the home of John Fell, Bergen County Revolutionary War patriot and member of the First Continental Congress of the United States. Fell was a merchant who before the Revolution had vessels plying the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers. He served the county as a Justice of Peace and a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. As a member of the First Continental Congress of the United States, Fell ratified the Constitution. During the revolution he had a reputation as a “great Tory hunter” and on April 22, 1777 was taken prisoner at his home by a band of 25 Loyalist raiders and imprisoned in New York City. Fell was paroled on January 7, 1778 and permitted to go home on May 11. Fell kept a diary while he was a member of the Congress for the State of New Jersey from November 6, 1778 to November 30, 1779. The original is kept in the Library of Congress. Open for special events.</p>

          <p>The 18th century historic Kearney House, known also as the “Blackledge-Kearney House,” contains exhibits and holds public events that reflect Hudson River life. On November 20, 1776, British General Cornwallis’ army began landing in force, having crossed in the early morning from NYC with an army of 5000. An old marker near here shows that it was once believed they landed at this spot, leading to the Kearny House, for many years, to be mistakenly called “Cornwallis Headquarters.” Although some troops may have climbed up the Palisades at this site, extensive research by Cresskill Historian John Spring, leading up to the Bicentennial in 1976, showed that the British soldiers and Hessians came ashore over 1½ miles south of this point at what is called “Huyler’s Landing” or “Lower Closter Landing.” The British began climbing the steep trails of the Palisades before marching 6 miles south to attack Fort Lee (then known as Fort Constitution). A new interpretive marker “Untangling Folklore from Fact” was erected by the PIP in 2009. For additional historic information: www.njpalisades.org/cn1998_11.htm</p>

Burdette was a New York merchant who bought 400 acres near Edgewater in 1756 and founded a trading post and ferry service, transporting goods and people on the Hudson River from New Jersey across to New York. During the war, the landing played a role in the movement of American supplies and soldiers.

          <p>Located on the cliffs overlooking the Hudson River with spectacular views of the George Washington Bridge, Fort Lee played significant part in America’s fight for independence when General Washington and his Continental Army, who were stationed here, were driven out by the advancing British army on November 20, 1776. It was the beginning of NJ’s role as the “Crossroads of the American Revolution.” The Visitor Center provided information on the role of Fort Lee in the American Revolution with two floors of displays that tell the story of the tumultuous New York campaign of the fall of 1776—culminating in the Continental Army’s "Retreat to Victory" across the Jerseys. Events are held here throughout the year and visitors can walk the paths and enjoy the scenic views of the Hudson River.</p>

The army marched down Main Street and camped on the Green during November 20-21, 1776.</p>

Washington was a frequent visitor at the house and stayed a night during the retreat of 1776. Washington was there when he heard of the planned attack on Fort Washington in November 1776. He had his headquarters here when the British landed at Lower Closter’s Landing.</p>

Poor was in the area because Washington had amassed an army there for a planned attack on New York City which never materialized. He died of fever three years later near Hackensack and was buried in the Church on the Green’s cemetery, which is across the street from the monument. Washington and Lafayette, along with many troops, were among the dignitaries at Poor’s full military funeral. </p>

          <p>This National Historic Landmark building started out as c. 1760 Dutch sandstone house. During the Revolution the house was owned by Lt. Col. James Marcus Prevost, who died before the Revolution. His widow, Theodosia, liked to entertain influential people, especially military. In July 1778 General George Washington and his troops were traveling through this area. When Washington and his entourage stopped at a local house, Theodosia invited him to stay at her home. He and his officers were entertained at The Hermitage from July 10 to 14, 1778. It is not certain whether he stayed in the house itself or camped on the grounds. Several important pieces of correspondence went out from here during his visit. Among other notable people to visit the house during the war were James Monroe, William Paterson, the Marquis de Lafayette, Alexander Hamilton, Lord Sterling (General William Alexander), Peggy Shippen Arnold, and Aaron Burr. Theodosia eventually married Aaron Burr, at the time a colonel in the Continental Army. The Hermitage is open to the public for guided tours year-round Wednesday through Sunday.</p>

General Washington arrived in about three-quarters of an hour, and marched at the head of the troops towards the bridge, which place I expected we should have a brush for; however, they did not choose to dispute it with us, and the greatest part of our troops went over the bridge, the rest over the ferry, except some which passed at a mill on a small creek, between the bridge and the ferry, and made their way through some marshy grounds up to the town of Hackensack, and there passed the river."</p>

          <p>This National Register historic house was built by the Van Allen family in 1748. The house occupied a strategic position in the area called The Ponds. At the time of the Revolution, the road it was on was one of the six passes which breached the Watchung Mountain chain. It was also near Valley Road (now Rt. 202) one of the most important supply arteries in the colonies. In the summer of 1777, the British General Bourgoyne’s army captured Fort Ticonderoga and the survival of the American northern army was in doubt. Washington quickly left Morristown and headed north on Valley Road. His destination was Suffern, to guard against a move by General Howe toward the American capitol, then in Philadelphia, or a thrust northward to join Bourgoyne. By Monday afternoon, July 14, the Americans had reached The Ponds where Washington called a halt to the day’s march due to the muddy conditions of the roads. Washington established his temporary headquarters that afternoon at the Van Allen house and soon received the word that the American northern army had escaped Ticonderoga and was still in the field. Washington decided to remain at the Van Allen house another day. Now a museum and headquarters of the Oakland Historical Society, it is open for tours and events during the year. </p>

They were under the leadership of Colonel George Baylor, a former aide to Washington. There were 67 killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Baylor’s second in command, Major Alexander Clough, a seasoned officer and one of Washington’s intelligence officers, died a few days later from his injuries. Baylor survived but the injuries he received contributed to his death two years later. On October 6, after receiving reports on the tragedy, the Congress (in Philadelphia) decided to investigate and a resolution was passed that New Jersey’s Governor Livingston be directed to inquire into the event. Both Livingston and General Washington requested that Major General Lord Sterling to direct the investigation. Remains of dragoons were found in 1967 during an archaeological excavation. There were later reentered in this park situated along the Hackensack River and is now marked with the sites original millstone.
